We're excited to announce that Google engineers will be visiting Bellevue College to deliver an exclusive talk on LLM (Large Language Model) hacking and AI security vulnerabilities!

# 🔒 BC INFOSEC CLUB GUEST SPEAKERS!

## 💬 Event Blurb

🛡️ Fortifying & Securing Agentic AI Systems 🤖
The shift to Agentic AI—autonomous systems that use tools and memory to achieve goals—introduces a new, critical threat landscape. Are we ready to build these systems? We'll explore how to identify and counter execution-based exploits that leverage an agent's access to external tools and runtime environments for malicious code execution. Most critically, we'll cover the strategic defense architecture: implementing robust platform guardrails and establishing essential human oversight.
